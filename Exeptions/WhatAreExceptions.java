// Types of errors -> Compile Time, Runtime, Logical
// Compile time -> Compiler will help you with those while compiling the code
// Logical -> While runnning code we can literally see the output and fix logical errors
// Runtime -> They occur on run time and stop the execution of the code so they must be 
// handled so here we use Exception handling.
