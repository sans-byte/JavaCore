// Packages in java are used to import the extra functionality
// or the code which is pre written
// The package name should be unique so the best way is
// reverse your company's domain name and use it
// com.google.something -> this will be unique

// tools.*                  //these both are not same
// tools.sometool.*         // as * only import all files in current folder not all folders
